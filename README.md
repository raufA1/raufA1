## 🚀 What I Do

I love building tools that make development easier, and I use AI extensively in my workflow. Most of my projects involve integrating AI into practical development tools - from CLI interfaces to automation scripts.

### My Approach
- **AI-First Development** - I use AI tools for coding, planning, and problem-solving
- **Practical Tools** - Focus on solving real problems I encounter in my own work
- **Learning in Public** - Sharing what I build and learn along the way
- **Automation** - If I do it more than twice, I try to automate it
